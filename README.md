|**Part 1: A summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP traffic log.**| Explanation      | 
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
|<p>- A. As part of the DNS protocol, the UDP protocol was utilized to reach out to the DNS server to obtain the IP address for the domain name yummyrecipesforme.com. However, the ICMP protocol was employed to send an error message, indicating problems in connecting to the DNS server. </p> <p>- B. The UDP message sent from your browser to the DNS server is displayed in the first two lines of each log event. The ICMP error response from the DNS server to your browser appears in the third and fourth lines, with the error message “udp port 53 unreachable.” Since port 53 is associated with DNS protocol traffic, this indicates a problem with the DNS server. Additional evidence of DNS protocol issues includes the plus sign following the query identification number 35084, which indicates flags on the UDP message, and the "A?" symbol, which signifies flags related to DNS protocol operations.</p> <p>- C. Given the ICMP error response regarding port 53, it is very likely that the DNS server is not responding. This is further corroborated by the flags associated with the outgoing UDP message and the domain name retrieval attempt.</p>|<p>- **A. Include a brief summary of the tcpdump log analysis and identify which protocols were used for the network traffic**. The scenario summarizes the issue and identifies the protocols used. Thescenario states: “To load the webpage, your browser first sends a query to a DNS server via the UDP protocol to retrieve the IP address for the website's domain name; this is part of the DNS protocol...The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets to the DNS server, you receive ICMP packets containing the error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.” ” </p> <p>- B. **Provide a few details on what was indicated in the log.** The first and second step of the scenario section states that you performed a network analysis using tcpdump, which recorded UDP packets from your source computer to the IP address and port for the DNS server (203.0.113.2.domain). It also recorded the ICMP error responses from the DNS server back to your computer with the error message “udp port 53 unreachable.” We mention in the 6th step that “Port 53, is a port for DNS service,” which means this is an issue with the DNS server. We include further signs of issues with DNS performance in the fifth step of the scenario, “The plus sign after the query identification number indicates there are flags associated with the UDP message. The "A?" indicates a flag associated with the DNS request for an A record, where an A record maps a domain name to an IP address.</p> <p>- **C. Interpret the issues found in the log.** The Scenario section (or a quick internet search for “port 53”) will show that this port number is commonly used for DNS protocol communications. Since port 53 is unreachable and that port is commonly used for DNS server communications, you can conclude that the DNS server is unreachable or “not responding.” This could be caused by a DoS attack against the DNS server, for example.</p>|                                                                                                               

## Part 2: Explain your analysis of the data and provide at least one cause of the incident.

|<p> - D. In the afternoon, an incident occurred at around 13:24.</p> <p>- E. The IT team encountered this incident when several clients reported that they were unable to reach the client's website "yummyrecipesforme.com" due to the error "destination port unreachable".</p> <p>- F. Our team was tasked with investigating the issue so that our client's website can be reached once again.</p> <p>- G. We conducted a packet sniffing test by loading TCPDUMP, a network analyzer tool, and analyzed the log. Key findings were that port 53 was unreachable “port 53 unreachable”.</p> <p>- H. We investigated why the DNS server was down or the firewall blocked the traffic to port 53.</p> <p>- I. A likely cause of the incident could be that the DNS received an abnormal amount of UDP protocol requests, overloading the system and causing a denial of service DoS an attack or that there was a misconfiguration.</p>| <p>- D. **State when the problem was first reported.** This info was obtained from the log file date and time stamps. In the log, this is the first sequence of numbers displayed: 13:24:32.192571. This displays the time 1:24 p.m., 32.192571 seconds, with the hour in 24-hour format.</p> <p>- E Provide the scenario, events, and symptoms identified when the event was first reported. The statement is that “A handful of customers contacted your company to report that they were not able to access the company website, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load.”</p>- F. **Explain the current status of the issue.** The Scenario states that, "This incident, in the meantime, is being handled by security engineers after you and other analysts have reported the issue to your direct supervisor."</p><p>- G. **Describe info discovered from investigating the issue up to this point in time.** Provides a concise recap of what you did to investigate the issue. The Scenario states,“You visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” Next, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and load the webpage again. This time, you receive a lot of packets in your network analyzer. In the analyzer, you send UDP packets and receive an ICMP response to return to the host. The results contain an error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.””</p> <p>- H. **List the next steps in troubleshooting and resolving the issue.** The next step in troubleshooting is to determine if the DNS server is not functioning properly. If the DNS server is fine, the team should check the firewall settings to see if someone changed the configuration to block network traffic on port 53. Firewalls offer the ability to block network traffic on specific ports. Port blocking can be used to stop or prevent an attack.</p><p>- I. **Provide the suspected root cause of the problem.** Previously, you learned about several types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The goal of a DoS attack is to send a flood of information to a network device, like a DNS server, to crash it or make it unable to respond to legitimate network traffic. It is possible that an attacker disabled the DNS server with a DoS attack. Alternatively, someone from your team could have made a configuration change on the firewall that blocked port 53.</p>
