|**Part 1: A summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP traffic log.**| Explanation      | 
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
|<p- A. As part of the DNS protocol, the UDP protocol was utilized to reach out to the DNS server to obtain the IP address for the domain name yummyrecipesforme.com. However, the ICMP protocol was employed to send an error message, indicating problems in connecting to the DNS server. p> - B. The UDP message sent from your browser to the DNS server is displayed in the first two lines of each log event. The ICMP error response from the DNS server to your browser appears in the third and fourth lines, with the error message “udp port 53 unreachable.” Since port 53 is associated with DNS protocol traffic, this indicates a problem with the DNS server. Additional evidence of DNS protocol issues includes the plus sign following the query identification number 35084, which indicates flags on the UDP message, and the "A?" symbol, which signifies flags related to DNS protocol operations.- C. Given the ICMP error response regarding port 53, it is very likely that the DNS server is not responding. This is further corroborated by the flags associated with the outgoing UDP message and the domain name retrieval attempt.|- **A. Include a brief summary of the tcpdump log analysis and identify which protocols were used for the network traffic**. The scenario summarizes the issue and identifies the protocols used. Thescenario states: “To load the webpage, your browser first sends a query to a DNS server via the UDP protocol to retrieve the IP address for the website's domain name; this is part of the DNS protocol...The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets to the DNS server, you receive ICMP packets containing the error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.” ” - B. **Provide a few details on what was indicated in the log.** The first and second step of the scenario section states that you performed a network analysis using tcpdump, which recorded UDP packets from your source computer to the IP address and port for the DNS server (203.0.113.2.domain). It also recorded the ICMP error responses from the DNS server back to your computer with the error message “udp port 53 unreachable.” We mention in the 6th step that “Port 53, is a port for DNS service,” which means this is an issue with the DNS server. We include further signs of issues with DNS performance in the fifth step of the scenario, “The plus sign after the query identification number indicates there are flags associated with the UDP message. The "A?" indicates a flag associated with the DNS request for an A record, where an A record maps a domain name to an IP address.”C. Interpret the issues found in the log. The Scenario section (or a quick internet search for “port 53”) will show that this port number is commonly used for DNS protocol communications. Since port 53 is unreachable and that port is commonly used for DNS server communications, you can conclude that the DNS server is unreachable or “not responding.” This could be caused by a DoS attack against the DNS server, for example.|                                                                                                               

## Part 2: Explain your analysis of the data and provide at least one cause of the incident.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|In the afternoon, an incident occurred. The IT team encountered this incident when several clients reported that they were unable to reach the client's website due to an error. The team was tasked with investigating the issue. They loaded TCPDUMP, a network analyzer tool, and analyzed the network. Key findings from the IT department included the error message “port 53 unreachable” when sending an HTTPS request to the DNS. A likely cause of the incident is that the DNS received an abnormal amount of UDP protocol requests, overloading the system and causing a DoS.|
